Well, the article entitled "Using English" instead of "Learning English".
Yep, it's `using`.
We always treat English as  `knowledge` that can be taught and learned, while I realized that it's exactly a mistake.

We accept knowledge via language, which is more likely to a media.
It's time to build my bridge, making it much more wider to pass through the vehicles of information or knowledge or meaningful thoughts.
Known or unknown Words poured through the bridge entry.
Over the bridge a dozen colorful banners of happiness and achievability whip back and forth in the wind.

It's hard for me to write a post and read enough articles every day for linguistic trainning but to do it.
