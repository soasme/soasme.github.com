I saw sentences with "complicated" structure ever before, parsing them in my best looked like a lexical analyser drawing token tree word by word.
A long time past, when I thought I were an old buzzing PC , I got the meaning if lucky I knew all the words at last.

No sooner had I found it the wrong way to learn English than I changed my idea.
I should have read more, listened more, and writen more.

Ah, I had browsed [a simple story](http://bizbox.ca/kidlet/) written by an eight-year-old girl just now.
That's [interesting](http://justinjackson.ca/words.html).
It seems my English level is lower than her.

Well, I will learn more words and write more in the next half year.
As said the girl's farther, just start with one page, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then iterate on that.
Good luck.
