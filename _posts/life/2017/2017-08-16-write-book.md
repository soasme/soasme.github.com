This is a very casual workday afternoon. Just want to take a quick
break now and write down some of my thoughts here. I never expect
I could stand here listening "世界が終るまでは" when I was young.
How I wish I could told myself at that time that life is changing all
the time. I admit that this old song recall me so much. Those memories
are too vague to read now. I'm trying my best to figure out who I am
and what person I am going to be, with regards to things I did.

I took a lot of time adjusting my life track these years. And I'm so
happy that my wife supports me at all time. For the next many many
years, I don't have ability to foresee what's going on. But I'm for
sure one thing that I will get close to the things I'm pursuing.

For years, I've spent a lot of time writing tons of shit codes and producing
very little things. I'm not satisfied with the result at all. I failed to
keep my enthusiasm long and strong. It's too often I jumped into another
project before I finished it. Side-project is some kind of poison.
Some people claim you could get great benefits from building side
project. But I'm started to doubt that. I'd say it's like I'm wasting
my effort doing something meaningless. One thing I could learn from
it is probably the experience, which I would say it's much less than
what I earned from work.

The aha moment isn't too late for me I guess. Some years ago, my boss
asked me if I'm rich, then what would I do? I answered him that I
would stay at home, learning stuff and write book. I didn't realized
that I've already pictured the ideal life. The condition here is not
that important at all. Even if I'm not rich, I could still run these
things as well. So why not start now.

That's it. I'm writing a new book now. Normally I won't say things too
early. But I think I'm walking on the right track now. I don't know
how useful it will be. But for me myself, it has shown positive feedback
now. When I started to explain things simple but correct, I found it
much harder than I thought. Without gaining a deep knowledge of one
thing, I couldn't explain it well. That intrigues me to keep learning.
