title: Without You
---

I live in eternal dark.

Hope was only in last era.

Why would anybody like you,

Rather leaving me alone.

You mapped yourselves into this perfect moment,

In this tiny photo,

With shiny sunlight.

---

Where should I go?

How would I live

Without you?

---

Where should I go?

How could I fight

Against all odds?
