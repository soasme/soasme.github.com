It has been six months since last time I wanted to write a book. Good news is that I have a table of content and a few chapters ready. The title of the book is `Architecture in a Nutshell`. When started writing, I realized I have insufficient knowledge on the big picture. So I figured out a way to craft my skill - Techshack. I think without broad range of in-taking, I wouldn't be able to make it happen. Now techshack has evolved into a weekly letter. And I have thousands of notes that can be used for writing a book.

In the next few months, I will keep contributing chapters and send some previews to friends or workmates. Hopefully, we can see alpha version of the book in the end of the year (2018).
