* Reading `Nature` have more fun than `BBC News` or sort of something like that.
* `Scientific American` grab my curiosity  I like its podcast.
* `TED` is not a good choice, for distraction often.
* `Old Friends` teaches me so many slang.
* Still hate writing. :(
* Archive notes to `Evernote`.

Improvements may not show directly, but I can feel it.
