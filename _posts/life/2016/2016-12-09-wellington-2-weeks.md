title: 2 WEEKS IN WELLINGTON
---

We have been in Wellington for two weeks.
When Taz asked us how long have we been here and we answered him, he said time passed so fast.

We came to Wellington through Northern Explorer, a scene viewing train in New Zealand.
There are so many sheep and cows, all standing or laying down on the grass ground.
We have never seen such huge amount of creatures before, so we just decided to stand on scene-viewing platform almost our entire journey.

We meet an old friend Tony at the corner of street.
It's far more beyond surprised, as the probability of meeting someone in an unfamiliar city is like 0.000001%.
His wife and he offered our a load of information, which is important to us.
Thanks so much!

Yay, A great thanks to Sarah & Taz (Hello, Holly) as well.
Thanks for their kindness and generous helps.
We are so happy living in their house.
Well, actually, we called it "home".
It's in churton park, surrounded by hills and fogs.

We were going to buy a used car in Wellington.
But it turns out to be too early for us.
Wellington is too small to buy a car.
Although taking bus costs a lot, it's still worthwhile.

Both my dear wife and I love Wellington now.
We believe that this is really a perfect city to settle down.
Although it's hard to forecast the future.

Most of the time, I wrote code and did technical readings.
I sent my resume to any potential employers in the rest of the times.
It's so close to Xmas, so I guess most companies won't open their positions (SAD).
I refreshed the job seeking site these days, and saw no updates eventually.
This is frustrating. But I have to tell myself that it's fine.
To tell the truth, I have only sent four or five resumes out.
That's not lame for me. It's because there are only a few jobs after November.

After all, I got a telephone discussion today. I saw it as a good start.
I will do some programming tomorrow and finish the technical test.
