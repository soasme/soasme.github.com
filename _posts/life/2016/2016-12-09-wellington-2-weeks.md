title: 2 WEEKS IN WELLINGTON
---

We have been in Wellington for two weeks.
When Taz asked us how long have we been here and we answered him, he said time passed so fast.

We came to Wellington through Northern Explorer, a scene viewing train in New Zealand.
There are so many sheep and cows, all standing or laying down on the grass ground.
We have never seen so many creatures before, so we decide to stand on scene-viewing platform almost our entire journey.

A great thanks to Sarah & Taz. Thanks for their helps and warm house.
We are so happy living in their house. Well, actually, we call it "home".
It's in churton park, surrounded by hills and fogs.

We were plan to buy a used-car in Wellington.
But it turns out that it might be too early for us to do that.
Wellington is too small to buy a car, especially at this time.
Although taking bus costs a lot, it's still worthwhile.

Both my dear wife and I love Wellington now.
We believe this is really a perfect city to settle down.

Most of the time, I wrote code and did technical readings.
I sent my resume to any potential employers in the left times.
It's so close to Xmas, so I guess most companies won't open their positions anyway.
I refreshed the job seeking site, and found almost no updates eventually.
This is frustrating. But I have to tell myself that it's fine.
To tell the truth, I have only sent three or four resumes out.
That's not lame for me. It's because there are so little jobs these days. T-T

After all, I got a telephone discussion today. I saw it as a good start.
I will do some programming tomorrow and finish the technical test.
