As I found that Tech Shack is a great way for me to master programming skills, I believe I could copy the process and paste it into any topic as I want, like for instance, Language learning!
This is nothing but to simply build habit. I basically can chop a great domain into small chunks and absorb them in an easy way.
In the next few days, I will try to run an interesting initiative called Crab Shack, which is mostly for learning English.
Things I will record could possibly be game, vocabulary, podcast, video, etc.
We'll soon see. :)
