Six months have passed since my light bulb was on. Let's get things sorted.

## Concrete Architecture

First thing first, this project [enqueuezero](https://enqueuezero.com/) is on track. In particular, now it's getting close to seeing the outline of the book.
[Concrete Architecture](https://enqueuezero.com/category/architecture.html) will be the book describing how the software architecture is. It has three parts:

* Part I: Architecture Styles. It explains the general building styles of the software.
* Part II: Architecture Blocks. It describes the solid pieces of software architecture.
* Part III: Architecture Examples. It provides real-life architecture examples, including open source software and those well-known tech-companies' software.

## Hands-On Cloud Native Application

Second, I'm working on another project since the beginning of the month (Jan 2019) - [tomato-coffee](https://github.com/soasme/tomato-coffee). I was unclear at first, but now I know what I'm expecting.
"Hands-On Cloud Native Application" will likely be the book title. It will serve as both a document and a memo on how I development, and release my Pomodoro application to the cloud. It has below chapters (draft):

* [ ] Introduction

* [ ] Chapter 6. Sign in from GitHub via Authlib
* [ ] Chapter 7. SQL Migration via Alembic
* [ ] Chapter 8. Front-end & Backend-end Integration
* [ ] Chapter 9. Spec for React App, Test for Flask App

Part II: DevOps

* [ ] DevOps Introduction
* [ ] Chapter 10. Deploy to Heroku via Terraform
* [ ] Chapter 11. Continuous Integration via Travis
* [ ] Chapter 12. Deploy to AWS EKS via Terraform
* [ ] Chapter 13. Write a Helm Chart
* [ ] Chapter 14. Deploy to Kubernetes(minikube/EKS/GKE/AKS) via Terraform

Part III: Ops
Ops Introduction
* [ ] Chapter 15. Collect Metrics via Prometheus
* [ ] Chapter 16. Collect Logs via Fluentd
* [ ] Chapter 17. Perform APM/Ping Check
* [ ] Chapter 18. Perform Health Check via StatusPage
* [ ] Chapter 19. Build a Monitoring Dashboard via Grafana
* [ ] Chapter 20. Automate Toil Work
* [ ] Summary

## Summary

By writing the posts in the enqueuezero, I realized writing is not an easy thing but it's far from complicated. Sorting out the ideas and understanding the relationship between them is the most important thing. Then it's all about adding words, grammar check, ~~delete and rewrite~~ refactor, pretty much like the programming loop. Hopefully, I'll get more updates next time. :)
