Six months have passed since my light bulb was on. Let's get things sorted.

## Concrete Architecture

First thing first, it's still ongoing. I'm pretty amazed that I'm still working on this project [enqueuezero](https://enqueuezero.com/). In particular, now it's getting close to seeing the outline of the book.
[Concrete Architecture](https://enqueuezero.com/category/architecture.html) will be the book describing how the software architecture is. It has three parts:

* Part I: Architecture Styles. It explains the general building styles of the software.
* Part II: Architecture Blocks. It describes the solid pieces of software architecture.
* Part III: Architecture Examples. It provides real-life architecture examples, including open source software and those well-known tech-companies' software.

## Hands-on Full-Stack Web Application Development in Cloud Era

Second, I'm working on another project since the beginning of the month (Jan 2019) - [tomato-coffee](https://github.com/soasme/tomato-coffee). I was unclear at first, but now I know what I'm expecting.
"Hands-on Full-Stack Web Application Development in Cloud Era" is the title that came up to my mind this morning I was on commuting. It will serve as both a document and a memo on how I development, and release my Pomodoro application to the cloud. It has below chapters (draft):

* Introduction
* Chapter 1. Understand the Business
* Chapter 2. Run a Pomodoro Timer in React
* Chapter 3. Manage States via XState
* Chapter 4. Mocking API via JSON-Server
* Chapter 5. Write a Real API via Flask
* Chapter 6. Sign in from GitHub via Authlib
* Chapter 7. SQL Migration via Alembic
* Chapter 8. Front-end & Backend-end Integration
* Chapter 9. Staging Environment in Heroku via Terraform
* Chapter 10. Spec for React App, Test for Flask App
* Chapter 11. Continuous Integration via Travis
* Chapter 12. Continuous Delivery via Terraform
* Chapter 13. Improve Observability via Prometheus
* Chapter 14. Build a Monitoring Dashboard via Grafana
* Chapter 15. SLO, SLI, SLA, and Operations
* Summary

## Summary

By writing the posts in the enqueuezero, I realized writing is not an easy thing but it's far from complicated. Sorting out the ideas and understanding the relationship between them is the most important thing. Then it's all about adding words, grammar check, ~~delete and rewrite~~ refactor, pretty much like the programming loop. Hopefully, I'll get more updates next time. :)
